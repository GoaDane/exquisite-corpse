In the time where the organic world was on its death bed, lived a Menahune from the lost islands of Niihau.
He travel as far away as he could reach to see what things where like in a land called Anderletch.
Delightful was his new adventure so far; he found all kinds of tastey treats to write stories home about.

During his trip he met several groups of people. The Hallois, a tribe that speaks a strange language called Dutch, 
the Brussels people, who have a strange passion for fries and beer, and others that he preferred not to disturb. 
Once he arrived in Anderlecht, he realized that the inhabitants of this region had a strange admiration for a god called "Football".
