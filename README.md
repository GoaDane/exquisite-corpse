In the time where the organic world was on its death bed, lived a Menahune from the lost islands of Niihau.
He travel as far away as he could reach to see what things where like in a land called Anderletch.
Delightful was his new adventure so far; he found all kinds of tastey treats to write stories home about.

During his trip he met several groups of people. The Hallois, a tribe that speaks a strange language called Dutch, 
the Brussels people, who have a strange passion for fries and beer, and others that he preferred not to disturb. 
Once he arrived in Anderlecht, he realized that the inhabitants of this region had a strange admiration for a god called "Football".
A strange sport played with a ball followed by two teams of 11 peoples.
They must coordinate to gather and then put the ball in the adversarie's goal. Each time
they do that they get more point. But no explanations can explain this cult.

Football players were considered as gods. They couldn't go in the streets without being jumped on by hundreds of people.
It was really sad for them to not be able to be free. Hopefully, they had beers and fries to be more happy.
And money, a lot of money. Money money money money $$$$$$$$.
